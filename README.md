# Background
Determined and passionate about learning about data and improving my SQL skills in order to land my first internship or my first job in the data world, I sought out different articles, and videos. I came across a youtube video teaching SQL that contained this dataset, a dataset that allows me to explore and navigate the 2023 data analyst/scientist job market more effectively. The data was obtained from Luke Barousse's [SQL course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql), containing insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I answered through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the available entry level/junior data analyst/science jobs or internships?
2. What skills are required for the entry level data analyst/science jobs or internships?
3. What are the most in demand skills for entry/junior/intern level data analysts/scientists?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka it's in high demand and a high paying skill)?

# Tools I used
To explore the data job market, I made use of several important tools:

- **SQL**: This served as the foundation of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract valuable insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management systme, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Here's how I approached each question: 

### 1. Available entry level/junior data analyst/science jobs or internships
To identify the available roles I created two queries, one for data analyst and the other for data scientist positions, filtering them by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs along with those based in New York or Florida. This query highlights the available opportunities in the field.

```sql
-- for data analysis
SELECT
    job_id,
    name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    ROUND(salary_year_avg, 2) AS salary,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS jpf
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim AS cd ON jpf.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE
    (job_title ILIKE '%Data Analyst intern%' 
    OR job_title ILIKE '%Entry level Data Analyst%' 
    OR job_title ILIKE '%Junior Data Analyst%')
    AND (job_location ILIKE '%New York%' 
    OR job_location ILIKE '%Florida%' 
    OR job_location ILIKE '%Anywhere%%')
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg
```

Here's the breakdown of the available entry/junior level data analyst roles and internships in 2023:
- Junior and entry-level data analyst roles in 2023 were dominated by remote opportunities, with ‚ÄúAnywhere‚Äù being the most frequent job location. Major cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles also remained top destinations, showing a healthy mix of remote and in-person demand.
- A small number of companies, such as Get It Recruit and DonorSearch, accounted for a significant portion of job listings, often posting repetitive titles like ‚ÄúJunior Data Analyst‚Äù or ‚ÄúEntry-Level Data Analyst.‚Äù This suggests that many roles are posted at scale or involve recurring openings.
- Most salaries for these roles fall between $40,000 and $70,000, with only a few breaking into six figures. Higher-paying roles are likely tied to technical specializations or companies in high-cost areas, while the average reflects typical entry-level compensation.
- The most common job titles include variations of ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù and ‚ÄúEntry-Level Data Analyst,‚Äù indicating a heavy focus on foundational skills and generalist responsibilities in data preparation, reporting, and dashboarding.
- Hiring activity was consistent throughout the year, with peaks in January, May, and September, hinting at seasonal trends such as internship recruitment, fiscal planning cycles, or post-graduation hiring waves.
