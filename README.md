# Background
Determined and passionate about learning about data and improving my SQL skills in order to land my first internship or my first job in the data world, I sought out different articles, and videos. I came across a youtube video teaching SQL that contained this dataset, a dataset that allows me to explore and navigate the 2023 data analyst/scientist job market more effectively. The data was obtained from Luke Barousse's [SQL course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql), containing insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I answered through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the available entry level/junior data analyst/science jobs or internships?
2. What skills are required for the entry level data analyst/science jobs or internships?
3. What are the most in demand skills for entry/junior/intern level data analysts/scientists?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka it's in high demand and a high paying skill)?

# Tools I used
To explore the data job market, I made use of several important tools:

- **SQL**: This served as the foundation of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract valuable insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management systme, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Here's how I approached each question: 

### 1. Available Entry/Junior Level Data Analyst/Science Roles or Internships
To identify the available roles I created two queries, one for data analyst and the other for data scientist positions, filtering them by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs along with those based in New York or Florida. This query highlights the available opportunities in the field.

```sql
-- for data analysis
SELECT
    job_id,
    name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    ROUND(salary_year_avg, 2) AS salary,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS jpf
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim AS cd ON jpf.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE
    (job_title ILIKE '%Data Analyst intern%' 
    OR job_title ILIKE '%Entry level Data Analyst%' 
    OR job_title ILIKE '%Junior Data Analyst%')
    AND (job_location ILIKE '%New York%' 
    OR job_location ILIKE '%Florida%' 
    OR job_location ILIKE '%Anywhere%%')
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg
```

Here's the breakdown of the available entry/junior level Data Analyst roles and internships in 2023:
- Junior and entry-level data analyst roles in 2023 were dominated by remote opportunities, with ‚ÄúAnywhere‚Äù being the most frequent job location. Major cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles also remained top destinations, showing a healthy mix of remote and in-person demand.
- A small number of companies, such as Get It Recruit and DonorSearch, accounted for a significant portion of job listings, often posting repetitive titles like ‚ÄúJunior Data Analyst‚Äù or ‚ÄúEntry-Level Data Analyst.‚Äù This suggests that many roles are posted at scale or involve recurring openings.
- Most salaries for these roles fall between $40,000 and $70,000, with only a few breaking into six figures. Higher-paying roles are likely tied to technical specializations or companies in high-cost areas, while the average reflects typical entry-level compensation.
- The most common job titles include variations of ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù and ‚ÄúEntry-Level Data Analyst,‚Äù indicating a heavy focus on foundational skills and generalist responsibilities in data preparation, reporting, and dashboarding.
- Hiring activity was consistent throughout the year, with peaks in January, May, and September, hinting at seasonal trends such as internship recruitment, fiscal planning cycles, or post-graduation hiring waves.

# What I learned

Throughout this journey, I significantly enhanced my SQL skills with powerful new capabilities:

- **Complex Query Crafting:** Built strong SQL skills by learning how to combine tables smoothly and use WITH clauses to create easy-to-follow temporary tables
- **Data Aggregation:** Learned how to use GROUP BY and started using functions like COUNT() and AVG() to quickly summarize and understand data.
- **Analytical Skills:** Improved my ability to solve real-world problems by learning how to turn questions into helpful SQL queries. 

# Conclusions
###Insights
1. **Available Entry/Junior Level Data Analyst/Science Roles or Internships**: Entry-level job availability in both data analytics and data science is strongest for remote positions, with steady hiring across the year and average salaries ranging from $40K‚Äì$75K. Common titles like ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù or ‚ÄúIntern‚Äù roles dominate listings, and a few companies are responsible for a large share of postings.
2. **Skills for Available Jobs**: Required skills for these roles consistently emphasize technical foundations‚ÄîSQL, Python, and Excel for analysts; Python, SQL, and machine learning frameworks for data scientists. Visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, as well as collaboration tools like Jupyter and Git, are also frequently requested.
3. **In Demand Skills for Entry/Junior Level Roles and Internships**: High-demand skills include SQL, Excel, and Python for analysts and Python, SQL, and R for data scientists. These tools appeared in thousands of job postings, reinforcing their essential role in early-career success across both fields.
4. **Skills Based on Salary**: Top-paying skills for analysts include cross-functional tools like Docker, Jenkins, and Java ($100K+), while data scientists command the highest salaries with Hadoop, Airflow, and specialized tools like Scala and Spark (ranging from $95K‚Äì$115K). Foundational skills like SQL and Python offer solid pay but are more common, reducing their salary premium.
5. **Most Optimal Skills to Learn**: Optimal skills to learn balance high demand and strong salary potential. For analysts, tools like Tableau, Python, and Excel offer the best returns. For data scientists, Python, SQL, and R top the list, while niche tools like Databricks and SAS also unlock high-paying, specialized roles.

###Closing Thoughts

This project significantly strengthened my SQL skills and deepened my understanding of the current job market for entry-level roles in both data analytics and data science. By analyzing real job posting data, I identified which roles are most available, which skills are most in-demand, and which tools lead to higher salaries. For beginners like myself, this information is incredibly valuable, it offers a clear roadmap to focus on foundational tools like SQL, Python, and Excel, while also highlighting the benefit of learning high-paying, specialized tools like Tableau, R, and Databricks. Most importantly, this project reinforced the importance of continuously adapting to industry trends and building a versatile skillset to stay competitive in the evolving data landscape.
