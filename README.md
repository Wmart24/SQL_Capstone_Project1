# Background
Determined and passionate about learning about data and improving my SQL skills in order to land my first internship or my first job in the data world, I sought out different articles, and videos. I came across a youtube video teaching SQL that contained this dataset, a dataset that allows me to explore and navigate the 2023 data analyst/scientist job market more effectively. The data was obtained from Luke Barousse's [SQL course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql), containing insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I answered through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the available entry level/junior data analyst or data science jobs or internships?
2. What skills are required for the entry level data analyst or data science jobs or internships?
3. What are the most in demand skills for entry/junior/intern level data analysts/scientists?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka it's in high demand and a high paying skill)?

# Tools I used
To explore the data job market, I made use of several important tools:

- **SQL**: This served as the foundation of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract valuable insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management systme, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
